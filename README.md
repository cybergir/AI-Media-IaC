## Project Description

This project is a modular, production-grade microservices platform designed for rapid development, deployment, and scaling of cloud-native applications. It leverages a modern DevOps toolchain-combining Infrastructure as Code (IaC), CI/CD automation, container orchestration, and advanced monitoring-to deliver robust, scalable, and maintainable software. Each service is independently deployable, following best practices in microservices architecture, and the platform is equipped for real-time observability, secure API management, and seamless integration with cloud environments.

Key Features:

- Microservices-based architecture for independent scaling and deployment[8][9]
- Automated CI/CD pipelines for fast, reliable software delivery[9][11]
- Infrastructure as Code using Ansible and Terraform for reproducible environments[11]
- Containerized services orchestrated via Docker Compose
- Real-time monitoring and alerting with Prometheus and Grafana
- Secure API gateway and reverse proxy with NGINX
- Comprehensive documentation and automation scripts

## Setup and Run Instructions

Prerequisites:

- [ ] Docker & Docker Compose installed
- [ ] Python 3.8+ (for backend)
- [ ] Git
- [ ] (Optional) AWS CLI, Terraform, Ansible, kubectl for advanced deployments

1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

2. Configure Environment Variables

- Copy the example file and edit as needed:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Build and Start Services

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

5. Infrastructure Provisioning (Optional)

- Use Ansible playbooks in `infrastructure/ansible/` to provision servers
- Use Terraform configs in `infrastructure/terraform/` for cloud resources

6. Monitoring

- Prometheus and Grafana are pre-configured for real-time metrics and dashboards
